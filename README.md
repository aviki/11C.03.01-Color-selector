This is a school addignment: Create a webpage where the user can select a color using &lt;input type="color">. Everytime the user changes the color, the webpage must update the display - i.e. it mustn't wait for the user to press OK. The selected color must be shown as the color itself, as a hexcode, as RGB values, and as HSL values.
